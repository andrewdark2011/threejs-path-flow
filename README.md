# Spline / Path Bend / Deformation Modifier for Three.js

The idea on how to do it was to apply some of the knowledge I already knew.

I first tried "bending" stuff writing TextGeometry in three.js.
(That eventually got removed due to complexity but the process build several of the foundation, eg. get tangents, spaced points etc).

Discovering and learning about calculating frenent frames was also important (writing tubes / extrude geometry)

The most useful article I read about doing so was from prideout's blog post. http://prideout.net/blog/?p=56

Next steps was the usual - looking into threejs examples and picking up what could be used.
In this case, picking off the Spline Editor and Obj Loader examples.
